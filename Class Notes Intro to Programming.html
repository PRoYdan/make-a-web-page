			<b><br>What is a web page</b><br>  
		 		A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
		
			<b><br>How Coding Works</b><br>
				Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the 		instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
		
			<b><br>Computers are Stupid</b><br>
				Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
				For example, if you forget to close a bold tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.

			    <b><br>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b><br>
				There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.

			<b><br>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b><br>
				You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
				Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag  and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) 	do not require a closing tag (like the break (br) tag).

				Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
				Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL use an a.

				<b>Introduction to serious programming</b>, Computer does nothing without a program  any compuation can be done on computer, program tells it what steps to take
				Python - named after Montey - its an interpreter - language we will be using - the interpreter is a program even..we program the program the interprets
				"The programs you'll write in this class will be Python code. Those will be input to another program which is a Python interpreter that follows the instructions in your code and it does that by following the instruction in its code... and you'll be able to run all that using your web browser."
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Think like a programmer moment </b>
					 follows instructions in code - prodecural thinking
					 quote demonstrates technological - empathy for how computers work
					 python program, interpreter, web browser different versions of the same thing - abstract thinking. 
			</p>
			<p>	Andy Practice
				Debugging  	one of the five ways programmers think. 
					Errors
						IndentationError: unexpected indent - indentation very important
						SyntaxError: invalid syntax - dont cap P
					Bugs - mistakes in code, develop system for finding and fixing

				<b>Focus attention (VARIABLE)</b><br>
					What is a variable?<br>
					What does it mean to assign value to a variable?<br>
					How is = differnt in math and programming (= vs ==)<br>
			</p>


				
			<p>
				<b>Getting started with Python</b>
					Print - Python command prints something out
					Expression - what is after the print command it can be simple like 3 or a complex computation. (anything that is valid python)
			</p>

			<p>
				Print 7*7*24 * 60
				Difference between computer science and computer programming
				- need computer language to remove ambiguity - very clear cut rules (biweekly (every two weeks or twice a week))
				- Do not want verbosity, need very specific steps for computer
				- Errors occur when not part of python language. Learn the python language. 2+2+ 
				- Python has gammar - must follow rules
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Notation for Python Backus </b>- Naur Form (lead of fortran language)
				<b> Backus - Naur Form </b> purpose to precisely describe the language in simple concise terms.
				&#60;Non -terminal&#62; ->replacment  Non-terminal means something we are not finished with
				terminals on the right side, terminals are never on the left side of rule, once we get to terminal we are done, nothing to replace.<br>
				<b>Derivation </b>- start with non terminal and follow rules to derive sequence of terminals
			</p>
				<div class="screenshot"><img src="images2/derivation.jpg" alt="can't load"> </div>
			<p>
				Python grammar for arithmetic expressions
				Expression is something that has value 
				Start with  Non terminal - expression operator expression - value action value

			<p><b>Quiz</b><br>
				# Write Python code to print out how far light travels <br>
				# in centimeters in one nanosecond.  Use the values
				# defined below.    <br>
				# speed_of_light = 299792458   meters per second<br>
				# centimeters = 100            one meter is 100 centimeters<br>
				# nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  one billionth of a second<br>
				print 299792458 * 100 * (1.0/1000000000) (use <b>.</b> in order to get ratio, if you use only integers you get back 
				only integers 
				2.7 GHz, 2.7 billion cycles per second

			</p>
		  <p><b>variable</b> introduced by assignment statement #name = expression, they can very, lower case, will error if not defined,
		  		give value to data, can change value easily<br>
				speed_of_light =299.... #number of meters light travels in a second <br>
				print speed_of_light <br>
				billionth =1.0/1000000000 <br>
				nanostick = print speed_of_light * billionth #length in meters<br>
				nanostick = print speed_of_light * billionth  #length in centimeters<br>
				cycles_per_second = 27000000000 #2.7 GHz<br>
				#almost like refreshing the cycles per sec when change the GHz value to 2.8..<br>
				Remember!!! = equals assignment == equals equal<br>
			</p>
			<p><b>String</b> sequence of characters surrounded by quotes<br>
				print 2 + 2 = 4 and print '2' + '2' = 22<br>
				single or double quotes - "" may be better so you can use ' in your string.<br>
				Plus operator name ="Pam"  print "hello " + name output hello Pam (concatinates two strings) add space to hello string<br>
				can print many strings print "hello " + "Pam" + "!" . Can't + "string"  + 9 but can multiply string by number "!" * 9 is valid
				print "!" * 9 output !!!!!!!!!
				[] used to extract from the string <b>!!! start with 0!!!</b><br>
				print "udacity" [0] output u<br>
				("udacity"[1+1]) output a<br>
				print "udacity"[-1] output y<br>
				s[0], (s+s)[0] = same output because the first letter of the concacted s is still the same as the single s<br>

 			<p>You can define functions (also known as procedure) to provide the required functionality. 
 				Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.
				Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).
				Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
				The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.
				The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
				The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
			</p>

				Syntax:
				def functionname( parameters ):
				   "function_docstring"
				   	function_suite
				   	return [expression]
				 def say_hello(name): (name is what we are passing in)
			    	 greeting = "Hello " + name + "!"
			    	 return greeting
				print say_hello("Pamela")
				print say_hello("David")

				def say_hello(name):
    			greeting = "Hello " + name + '!'
    			return greeting
				# In the previous example, you saw code that looked like what you see above.
				# Look at the first line. In that line, 'name' is a "parameter"
				# of the function say_hello

				# In the code below, the add_two_numbers function has two parameters.
				# What do you think will happen when you press "Test Run"?
				# Make a prediction and then press "Test Run"
				def add_two_numbers(number_1, number_2):
				    return number_1 + number_2

				print add_two_numbers(4, 3)
				print add_two_numbers(2, 6)
				print add_two_numbers(0, 9)

				# Once you've pressed Test Run, remove the comment characters from the 
				# code below and then make ONE modification so that the function does 
				# what the name says it should do.

				def subtract_two_numbers(number_1, number_2):
				    return number_1 - number_2

				print subtract_two_numbers(4, 3)
			</div>

				<b>Functions are made to take input, do something with it, and then produce output, they can be used for any type
				of input and can be used over and over, they must have return statement to avoid 'none' condition.</b>

			
				<b>Needs a return to return something other than none</b>
